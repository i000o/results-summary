## Overview

I took on this task to re-enter frontend skills after focusing on Javascript theory for a couple of months. It was a great way to remind myself of all the skills I've already attained and I enjoyed getting back into the flow of styling pages like this.

## Goal

My goal here was just to remind myself of the strong foundation in frontend skills I'm building on, and to begin committing again after an accidental dip in activity on GitHub, simply because I was practicing JS elsewhere. Following this, I intend to take on some FS projects to flesh out my portfolio as a full-stack engineer.

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass

## Process

- I started mapping out the HTML elements I could see, trying to plan ahead with the viewport sizes and compare how the mobile/desktop versions differ. I decided to use Flex as I couldn't see any areas that might become a problem unless I used Grid so I opted for that.
- I had forgotten a few things and had to jog my memory, referring back to other code I've written in the past on similar projects, but once I started exercising these muscles again, my instincts quickly returned. This felt good, but was startling having been a little out of practice. I decided not to less this type of gap build up again as recovering is another task in and of itself.
- I started with a mobile first design, having taken advice from another engineer who told me that those are the 'building blocks' of the design, and that the desktop version is a reshuffling of those. This kept the responsive designing a simpler task in my mind so I approached it that way and will only change it if I find something easier.
- I feel much more confident now using class names rather than HTML elements. It makes total sense why and helps my CSS to be extra readable to myself. I love classes.
- I used `background-color` a lot in this design and while I'm not totally confident on gradients, I got pretty close.
- I also used `ul` here, which I'm pretty comfortable with at this point. I enjoy making deliberate, semantic use of my HTML elements so that everything flows nicely on the page.
- I still really enjoy using Sass, although I've been encouraged to take on Tailwind by others devs. I'll take on something like this in due time, but for now, Sass' easy nesting/grouping of CSS declarations make the document so clean and easy to navigate.
- I had to jog my memory a little on media queries, but quickly recalled how to go about this. I've grown in confidence a lot in this area. When I first started, it could be a nightmare, but I have a good flow now.
- The active state was really easy to implement. It's easy to overlook these if you're keen to finish.
- I really enjoyed styling the `li`'s with the breakdown of the results. Refreshing on icons, `space-between`, `margin`, `padding` etc. was a nice return to foundational CSS concepts that can make something finicky really seamless.
- Overall, I'm really happy with the standard of design I'm consistently able to achieve. I have a keen visual eye and will notice the tiniest of details which can make me execessively harsh on my own outcomes, but when I reach a satisfactory standard, I can appreciate the impact of my attentiveness. It makes the component look really complete and when it holds up well dynamically, I'm really happy.

## Lessons

No big lessons here other than namely, don't stop committing! It's not nice to try to patch up chunks of time with your memory. Better to just keep on.

## Development

As I said in the [Overview](#overview), this was to warm me back up before I attempt some more advanced full-stack projects on FM. Thankfully, this article has helped me to feel confident approaching these heftier tasks in my mission to beef out my portfolio with some really strong projects that demonstrate my ambition.
